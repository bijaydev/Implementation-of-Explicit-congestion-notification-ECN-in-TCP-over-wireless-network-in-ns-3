## Course Code: CS821

## Assignment: #FP6

### Overview

 Explicit congestion notification (ECN) in TCP over wireless network is an IEEE paper which proposed to use ECN to solve the performance problems of TCP in wireless networks [1]. It is a minor modification to the working of ECN and TCP, but provides a significant improvement in the performance.
